# Enterprise Cybersecurity Platform

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the Enterprise Cybersecurity Platform, a comprehensive solution designed to provide advanced security monitoring, threat detection, and incident response capabilities.

The platform consists of two main components:

1.  **Frontend:** A modern, user-friendly interface built with Vite, TypeScript, and React. It provides dashboards, visualizations, and controls for interacting with the system. The frontend is designed to be deployed on Vercel.
2.  **Backend:** A robust API server built with Python and FastAPI. It handles data processing, business logic, integrations with network devices and security services, and communication with the database. The backend is designed to be deployed on Render.

## Key Features

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of network devices, systems, and security events.
*   **Threat Intelligence:** Integration with threat intelligence feeds to identify and prioritize potential threats.
*   **Vulnerability Management:** Tracking and managing vulnerabilities within the monitored environment.
*   **Incident Response:** Tools and workflows to manage and respond to security incidents.
*   **Advanced Analytics:** Data-driven insights and security scoring to assess and improve the organization's security posture.
*   **Multi-Device Support:** Designed to manage and monitor a variety of network devices, starting with MikroTik routers.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** Vite, TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, Recharts
*   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Redis
*   **Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend)

## Getting Started

For detailed information about the backend setup, development, and API documentation, please refer to the [Backend README](./backend/README.md).

*(Information about setting up and running the frontend will be added here as the frontend development progresses.)*
